### ðŸ“‘ End note 

After using context with NextJS and REMIX, and now using the original context hook I can see the big improvement that this two frameworks did incorporating Context in a much simplier way, anyways using the original hook is not hard at all, this project was not about its complexity, because it was a really simple app, but more to understand the basic concepts on how to use context
